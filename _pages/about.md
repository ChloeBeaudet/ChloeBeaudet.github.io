<p align="justify">Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in environmental economics at <a href="https://eng-psae.versailles-grignon.hub.inrae.fr/">Paris-Saclay Applied Economics</a> (INRAE, AgroParisTech, Paris-Saclay University), under the supervision of <a href="https://eng-psae.versailles-grignon.hub.inrae.fr/personalpages/david">Maia David</a> and <a href="https://leatardieu.wordpress.com/">LÃ©a Tardieu</a>. My thesis focuses on the socio-economic impacts of light pollution reduction policies in urban and periurban areas. I mainly rely on empirical tools: econometric methods for impact evaluation, spatial econometrics, non-market valuation methods.</p>

<p align="justify">Research interests: Environmental economics, urban sustainability and spatial planning, causal inference for public policy evaluation,  non-market valuation, spatial data analysis, machine learning, development economics.</p>
