<p align="justify">Welcome! I am a post-doctoral researcher in environmental economics at <a href="[https://eng-psae.versailles-grignon.hub.inrae.fr/">Paris-Saclay Applied Economics</a> (INRAE, AgroParisTech, Paris-Saclay University). In December 2025, I received my PhD from Université Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/maia-david">Maia David</a> and <a href="https://leatardieu.wordpress.com/">Léa Tardieu</a>. <em> PhD jury: <a href="https://www.centre-cired.fr/philippe-quirion/">Philippe Quirion</a>, <a href="https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/35112-ben-groom">Ben Groom</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/juliesubervie1/home">Julie Subervie</a>, <a href="https://pro.univ-lille.fr/magalie-franchomme">Magalie Franchomme</a>, and <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/rob-mcdonald-lead-scientist/">Robert McDonald</a>.  </em> </p>

<p align="justify"> My research focuses on individual preferences, social acceptability and well-being impacts of environmental policies to understand barriers to their implementation and inform policy design. In my dissertation, I address these questions through the original case of policies aimed at reducing light pollution. I primarily rely on empirical methods: econometric methods for impact evaluation, spatial econometrics, non-market valuation methods. </p>

<p align="justify">Research interests: Environmental economics, urban sustainability and spatial planning, causal inference for public policy evaluation,  non-market valuation, spatial data analysis, machine learning, development economics.</p>
