    <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify"><em>Urban planners continuously face the challenge of reducing artificial lighting to protect biodiversity while ensuring urban residents’ comfort and safety at night. Striking this balance is crucial for supporting urban residents broadly, yet it remains insufficiently explored in current research. Here we integrate remote sensing and ecological modeling to assess species’ requirements around light-pollution reduction with socioeconomic modeling to evaluate human residents’ acceptance of various street-lighting adjustments, aiming to identify the optimal lighting compromises for Montpellier, France, a midsized European city. We show that, depending on the spatial context, both tradeoffs and synergies can emerge when implementing light-pollution-mitigation measures. By integrating results into an RShiny application, we enabled urban planners to prioritize actions for each streetlight. Our findings underscore the importance of tailoring lighting policies to the specific environmental and social context rather than adopting a universal ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach.</em></p></details>

    <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify"><em>Light pollution has significantly increased in recent years, in concert with urban sprawl. Light pollution consequences for nocturnal wildlife, human health, and energy consumption are numerous but are poorly tackled in urban policies. The regulation and mitigation of light pollution is possible, but requires an important shift in the lighting paradigm, including in public lighting often managed by local authorities. One of the main sources of reticence of local authorities to regulate light pollution is the potential rejection by citizens of lighting changes. In this article, we investigate citizens’ willingness to accept the transition to more sustainable lighting regimes. We use a discrete choice experiment in a large French metropolis to measure the relative weight of different characteristics of public lighting – light intensity, light extinction, light colour – in respondents’ decisions. We show that respondents are globally open to public lighting shifts, but their preferences in terms of the changes are highly heterogeneous. By incorporating socioeconomic variables of respondents into our econometric models, we characterise the main profiles of preferences regarding lighting changes. This provides practical information to urban and environmental planners allowing them to match the municipalities where the need for light pollution control is a priority with those where measures seem socially acceptable by citizens.</em></p></details>

    <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify"><em>Poor people are disproportionally affected by natural hazards and disasters. This paper provides a review of the multiple factors that explain why this is the case. It explores the role of exposure (often, but not always, poor people are more likely to be affected by hazards), vulnerability (when they are affected, poor people tend to lose a larger fraction of their wealth), and socio-economic resilience (poor people have a lower ability to cope with and recover from disaster impacts). Finally, the paper highlights the vicious circle between poverty and disaster losses: poverty is a major driver of people’s vulnerability to natural disasters, which in turn increase poverty in a measurable and significant way. The main policy implication is that poverty reduction can be considered as disaster risk management, and disaster risk management can be considered as poverty reduction.</em></p></details>



## Work in progress

* **Mapping preferences derived from a choice experiment**, _with Léa Tardieu, Romain Crastes dit Sourd and Maia David_. [Working Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4931486). _Under review in Environmental and Resource Economics_.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify"><em>In recent decades, discrete choice experiments (DCEs) have proven useful for guiding policy-making decisions, particularly regarding the expression of individual preferences for various policy options. However, when considering spatial planning policies, the usefulness of results such as averaged individual or group preferences may prove limited for decision-makers, since the spatial heterogeneity of preferences is strong in most cases. This paper therefore proposes two methods for mapping, at a small spatial scale, preferences derived from a DCE. Both methods assess the influence of socio-demographic and spatial variables on the preferences to predict willingness to pay at a small spatial scale. Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine the method which best performs in theory. The methods are then compared empirically in the case of light pollution mitigation policies in the Montpellier Metropolitan Area (France). We conclude that, when applicable, the one-step method is the most fit for the purpose, although the two-step method shows practical aspects that can be of interest for applied research.</em></p></details>
